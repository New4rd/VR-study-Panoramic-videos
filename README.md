### A study on panoramic videos in virtual reality

Warning: GitHub does not allow uploading files over 100MB, videos are not included in this repository. The application therefore does not work, this deposit has the sole purpose of consulting the code. If you are interested in getting the code completed with the videos, convo me.

This repository contains the code made during my end-of-studies internship, at the Mediterranean Virtual Reality Center, in Luminy, for the University of Aix-Marseille.

The aim was to study the effects of distortion and discomfort experienced when a user watches a panoramic video with a virtual reality headset.
